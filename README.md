# E-gotcha

A web-based, tamagotchi inspired character needs guidance to eat, sleep, and exercise or else its health will drop! Bonus (in-progress) feature includes an email section; your character will increasingly receive emails in their inbox. The more emails they acquire, the more their health will decline. Delete, reply, and mark emails as spam to continue progressing through the character's lifetime.
